to install use :
sudo make install

to uninstall use :
sudo make uninstall

However you probably want to mess with some options before you do that...

To set a "friendly name" (the name the device appears as on the network) create a file named "friendlyName" in the src directory containing the name to use.
for example :
cd UPNPAudioPlayer/src
echo 'My UPNP Device' > friendlyName
make spotless
sudo make install

Stuff to tweak after you've installed :
If you don't want to start at boot time
sudo update-rc.d upnpaudio remove
(to re-enable "sudo update-rc.d upnpaudio defaults")

The installer installs to the following locations :
Binary : /usr/sbin/upnpaudiod
Start/Stop script : /etc/init.d/upnpaudio
UPnP device and service description XML : /etc/upnpaudio     [ Note : you can also change the Friendly Name here ]
Default command line parameters : /etc/default/upnpaudio     [ Note : default is to start on wlan0 network interface ]
Man Pages : /usr/share/man/man1/upnpaudiod.1.gz

Logs will go to /var/log/syslog
grep upnpaudioplayer /var/log/syslog
