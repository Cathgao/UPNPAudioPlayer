Stuff To Do :

The basics work in my set up :
	Playing a file & playing the next file in the playlist when it finishes
	Volume control
	Feedback of the track length + current position on the position slider at the control point
	Seek
	Pause/ Next/ Previous


Things that might be nice :
	Icons. Should be easy to add - they need to get added to the device description + the files need to be registered with GUPNP at startup (audio_player.c)
	Gapless playback. A pain. UPNP gives a "next track URI" action to specify the next track which would enable a renderer to buffer it and give a seamless playback. Problem is the synology control point I use doesn't call it. Also how are you supposed to know whether the playback *should* be gapless or whether you give a reasonable pause.  If anybody gets any good ideas let me know...


Places where (I know) it deviates from the UPNP spec
	UPNP says that if you implement the volume state variable (rendering control service) then you should also implement VolumeDB.  I didn't bother. It doesn't seem to break anything.
