My Setup


Not trying to plug anything - but the stuff below works for me. 

The "pi" :
	Debian Raspian OS
	TRIXES USB Soundcard - basically because I liked the colour...  Analogue audio into a stereo.
	Edimax EW-7811UN Wireless Network Adapter - because its small. And blue.
	Samsung power supply - I manage to run both the network + soundcard USB devices without needing a powered hub.
	I haven't bothered overclocking the PI or changing the GPU/ CPU memory split. I see it using around 30%-40% CPU and 15% memory while playing an aac stream.

Other UPNP devices (Media Server & Control Point)
	I use a Synology NAS & their AudioPlayer application which runs on iOS. I've not tried but I'm told this also works well on Andriod.


Installing the Network
I followed the instructions here : http://www.ctrl-alt-del.cc/2012/05/raspberry-pi-meets-edimax-ew-7811un-wireless-ada.html.  If you are using Raspian you don't need to bother with the firmware bits. You'll also need a version of the kernel module (8192cu.ko) that's compiled against Raspian. I found one here : http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80256631/8192cu-latest.tar.gz
Note : In the latest


USB Soundcard
The following worked :
sudo alsactl init
edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
comment out the last line (so usb audio can be the default soundcard). The last two lines should read :
# Keep and-usb-audio from being loaded as first soundcard
# options snd-usb-audio index=-2

create /etc/asound.conf put this in it :
pcm.!default {
        type hw
        card 0
}

ctl.!default {
        type hw
        card 0
}

Installation :
The makefile covers a really basic installation. To use :
cd ~
mkdir bin (if you don't already have one - probably also helpful to add ~/bin to your PATH env variable. I do this in .bashrc)
cd UPNPAudioPlayer/src
make clean ; make install

Now you can use the start_audio_player and stop_audio_player scripts to start and stop the app.
start_audio_player will put a log directory in your home directory. If you want it somewhere else set the AUDIOPLAYER_LOGS variable to some other directory.


Installation on a "headless" PI
I have a PI set up to start UPNPAudioPlayer when it boots. I also set up a user (audio_svc) for it to run from.

Set up the user :
sudo useradd -m -G audio, users audio_svc
sudo passwd audio_svc   (and enter a password)
su audio_svc
cd ~
Unpack the UPNPAudioPlayer.tgz package here.


To start UPNPAudioPlayer when the PI boots :
Create the following script in /etc/init.d.  I called it UPNP_audioplayer
-----
#!/bin/sh

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          audio_player
# Required-Start:    $remote_fs $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: UPNP AudioPlayer
# Description:
### END INIT INFO

case "${1:-}" in
  stop)
        echo "Stopping UPnP Audio Player"
        /home/audio_svc/bin/stop_audio_player
        ;;
  start)
        echo "Starting UPnP Audio Player"
        sudo -u audio_svc /home/audio_svc/bin/start_audio_player
        ;;
  *)
        echo "Usage: ${0:-} {start|stop}" >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
-----

finally :
cd /etc/init.d
sudo update-rc.d UPNP_audioplayer defaults
If you want to stop UPNPAudioPlayer starting :
cd /etc/init.d
sudo update-rc.d UPNP_audioplayer remove
